# bayes_drt2

`bayes_drt2` is a re-implementation of [`bayes_drt`](https://github.com/jdhuang-csm/bayes-drt) using the `cmdstan` interface to Stan instead of `pystan`. This addresses some issues with installation and the removal of optimization functionality in current versions of `pystan`. The functionality and structure of `bayes_drt2` is virtually identical to that of `bayes_drt`. If you are using `bayes_drt` without issue, there is no reason to switch to `bayes_drt2`. See the [tutorials for `bayes_drt`](https://github.com/jdhuang-csm/bayes-drt/tree/master/tutorials) for tutorials on how to use this package (the API is the same).

`bayes_drt2` is a Python package for inverting  electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data to obtain the distribution of relaxation times (DRT) and/or distribution of diffusion times (DDT).

`bayes_drt2` implements a hierarchical Bayesian model to provide well-calibrated estimates of the DRT or DDT without ad-hoc tuning. The package offers two methods for solving the model:
* Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling to estimate the posterior distribution, providing both a point estimate of the distribution and a credible interval
* L-BFGS optimization to maximize the posterior probability, providing a maximum *a posteriori* (MAP) point estimate of the distribution

It is also possible to perform multi-distribution inversions, e.g. to simultaneously fit both a DRT and a DDT, with these methods. This is an experimental feature and requires some manual tuning. See the tutorials for an example.

The package also provides ordinary and hyperparametric ridge regression methods, which may be useful for comparison or for obtaining initial estimates of the distribution. The hyperparametric ridge regression method is an implementation of the method developed by Ciucci and Chen (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2015.03.123) and expanded by Effat and Ciucci (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2017.07.050).
